# T7-Serverlist

This project provides a custom **server list** feature for **Call of Duty: Black Ops 3** (T7), allowing players to view and join multiplayer servers directly from the game's interface, much like Plutoniumâ€™s server list.

## **Features:**
- Displays a dynamic server list with details like **IP address**, **XUID**, **skill rating**, **ping**, and **player count**.
- Allows players to click on any server in the list to join.
- Automatically closes the server list when you enter a **lobby** or join a **game**.
- Easy to inject via **Process Hacker** or any other DLL injector.

## **How to Use:**
1. **Download the DLL** from the **Releases** section.
2. **Inject the DLL** into the game using **[Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)**.
3. Once injected, navigate to the **multiplayer** section of the game.
4. Click **"Find a Match"** to bring up the server list.
5. Choose a server from the list to join and start playing!

## **Requirements:**
- **Process Hacker** (or any DLL injector of your choice).
- **Call of Duty: Black Ops 3** (T7) to use the server list feature.

## **Important Notes:**
- The server list will automatically close once you enter a lobby or a game.
- This project is fully developed in **C++** and is intended for users comfortable with DLL injection.
- Make sure your game is running in an environment compatible with DLL injection for the feature to work.
